
Once it is installed if want to verify we can use this command.
#rpm –qa | grep cockpit

To install the cockpit first we install the cockpit through yum server.
# yum install cockpit*

After installing the package need to start the service.
# systemctl start cockpit

We can verify our cockpit service is running or not through this command.
#systemctl status cockpit

At last in the configuration step we need to allow cockpit service through the firewall.
# firewall-cmd -–permanent -–add-service=cockpit
# firewall-cmd -–reload 

If it is already allowed from the firewall so no need to do this step just verify it with using this command and you will see the cockpit is already added in services.
# firewall-cmd -–list-all

Note: Must add default cockpit port:9090
